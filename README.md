# Goals Tracker Application

This application is the first extension of the generic baseline 
[starter application](https://github.com/intuedge/hartl_rebranded), which began life as the 
[sample application](http://github.com/railstutorial/sample_app_2nd_ed) for the 
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails (2nd Ed.)*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/). 

It is intended to be part of a suite of mobile and web apps that first support personal focus and productivity, and then enable effective collaboration.
