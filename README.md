# Ruby on Rails Starter Application

This application began life as the [sample application](http://github.com/railstutorial/sample_app_2nd_ed) for the 
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails (2nd Ed.)*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/). In order to assess my understanding of the tutorial, and reuse the context and momentum established by following it, I determined that I would take Michael up on his generous provision of the sample code for reuse, as the basis for my first Ruby on Rails app.  As the first step in the process, I am starting from the end of the tutorial, and removing the overt branding as his sample app, as an exercise in test-first development a la Hartl.  Note that the original repo, and all of its commits, remain the root of this endeavor, and the initial rebranded version will be reusable on essentially the same basis as the original.
