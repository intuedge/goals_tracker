<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
  The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
  is a project to make a book and screencasts to teach web development
  with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This starter app
  is based on the original sample application for the tutorial. 
  It will hopefully be used to help teach beginning and intermediate Ruby on Rails
  through the [RailsBridge.org outreach program](http://railsbridge.org), getting more women into coding.
